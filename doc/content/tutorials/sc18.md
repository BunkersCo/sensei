# Supercomputing 2018

In 2018, we will present a half-day tutorial on SENSEI on Sunday, November 11th, from 1:30â€”5:00pm in room C147.
See [the SC18 program](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut142&sess=sess255) for details.
The [course materials](https://data.kitware.com/#collection/5a007cb58d777f31ac64ddfd/folder/5aeb10e78d777f068579708a)
will soon be available here:

+ Slides (PDF, 57 MB)
+ Virtual machine disk image (TBD)

The disk image is based on Ubuntu 18.04 and can be used with VirtualBox to try SENSEI out
without having to build it yourself.
However, once you decide to use it with your simulation,
you should build it yourself to avoid the overhead of a virtual machine.
